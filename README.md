When the program is run, the customer is prompted to enter the item number they would like to purchase or enter help to see a list of products.

The customer enters the item number and the quantity. Then the program thanks them for their purchase and shows them their total cost.

If there is insufficient stock the program tells the customer and shows them how many are available. The program is then restarted so they can change their order.

If the customer enters 'help', the program lists all item information and re-prompts for the item number.
